# it115-fl20-bio
a repo to store info for my public bio 
Heres some ideas about a profesional bio 
Short and sweet (to the point)
Identify your audience 
Start with a powerful first sentence (who you are) 
Tell a compelling story (greatest accomplishment, why youâ€™re unique) 
Call to action in bio (tells audience how to reach me/ see more of me)
Wrap it up with personality (end with something personal/relatable)
What makes you qualified 
Personality 
Platform dependent (will be different based on platform)
